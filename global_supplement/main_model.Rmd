## Overall model

### These notes are from the 2012 Supplement (this section needs added figures and table and equations an citations).


The overall Index  score is calculated as a linear weighted sum of the scores for each of the
public goal indices (I1, I2, . . . , I10) and the appropriate weights for each of the goals (α1, α2,..., α10), such that:

S =  , (Eq. S1)
where  1 i.

Derivation and application of the weights (αi) is described below (section 4).

Each goal score, Ii, is a function of its present status i x and an indication of its likely near-term
future status:
 . (Eq. S2)

The present status of goal i, xi, is its present status value, (Xi), relative to a reference point, Xi,R, uniquely chosen for each goal and rescaled 0-100 such that:
 . (Eq. S3)

The estimate of a goal’s likely near-term future status is a function of the present status modified by: recent trends in status (over the past ~5 years); current cumulative pressures acting on the goal (pi); and social and ecological resilience to negative pressures (measured as a function of governance and social institutions in place to protect or regulate the system and the ecological condition of the system; ri).  

The likely future status is then defined as:
   i F i i i i xˆ 1 1 1 T (1 )(r p ) x ,        (Eq. S4)

[Note: we need to cut the discount stuff because there are errors in it]

Both ri and pi are scaled such that 0  ,  1 i i r p , with 1 being the maximum value in both cases. The Trend (Ti) is constrained to -1.0 ≤ Ti ≤ 1.0 (i.e., values outside this range are clamped to range end values). 

Where Beta (β) represents the relative importance of the Trend versus the Resilience and
Pressure terms in determining the likely trajectory of the goal status into the future. We assume β=0.67 based on the idea that the direct measure of Trend is a better indicator of future (five years) condition than indirect measures of Pressure and Resilience. This assumption makes Trend twice as important.

The likely future status cannot exceed the maximum possible value for Status for each goal, which is 1.0. In reality data are rarely perfect, creating potential situations where likely future condition exceeds 1.0. To address these cases, we implemented two rules. First, if current Status = 1.0, then trend is set = 0.0, since any Trend > 0.0 in those cases must be due to incomplete or imperfect data. Second, Status and Likely Future Status scores were constrained to maximum value of 1.

We can therefore calculate the Index (I):

This formulation also allows for the assessment to be conducted using the goals that are of interest/use for a particular location. For example, few extractive use public goals are relevant to or valued in uninhabited regions, so calculation of the Index for these areas is based on a subset of goals. In this way, uninhabited areas that are pristine areas could score very high, even though they are not delivering more direct market-based benefits to people.




### add these details later
add a few notes on trend calculations here (now proportional change in trends)







The role of the Resilience and Pressure dimensions is to improve our understanding of the likely near-term future condition by incorporating additional information beyond that provided by the recent trend, Ti. Pressure or Resilience measures that were in existence in the past may have a cumulative effect that has not yet manifested itself in trend (e.g., for p: fishing pressure may have increasingly negative impacts as successive year classes of fish become increasingly less abundant; for r: establishment of a marine protected area (MPA) may require a number of years before its benefits become apparent). In addition, the recent trend does not capture the effect of current levels of Resilience (r) and Pressures (p). The expectation of a likely future condition suggested by the Trend will become more or less optimistic depending on the effects of r and p. If the effects are equal they cancel each other out.





The reference point, Xi,R, can be determined in four potential ways, depending on the conceptual
and data constraints for each goal2. Reference points can be estimated mechanistically using a
production function (e.g., maximum sustainable yield, MSY, for fisheries), spatially by means of comparison with another region (e.g., country X represents the best possible known case), temporally using a past benchmark (e.g., historical
