## Resilience calculations

To calculate Resilience for each goal (rx) we
assess three types of measures: ecological integrity
(YE), goal-specific regulations aimed at addressing
ecological pressures (G), and social integrity (YS).
The first two measures address ecological
resilience while the third addresses social
resilience. When all three aspects are relevant to a
goal, Resilience is calculated as:
S
E
x r Y G (1 )*Y

*     



 , (Eq. S11)
where the three types of measures are all scaled 0-
1, and gamma is assumed to be 0.5. We chose γ =
0.5 so that the weight of Resilience components
that address ecological systems vs. social systems
were equivalent, based on the same rationale as for
ecological pressures vs. social pressures, with the
intent, as best as possible, to have Resilience
measures directly matched with Pressures.
Ecological integrity, i.e. food web integrity, is
measured as relative condition of assessed species
in a given location (see ‘marine species’ data layer
description in section 7). As measured, it is not
directly relevant to all goals and so is omitted in
those instances, in which case rx = (G + YS)/2. The
goals where ecological integrity is not directly
relevant include Coastal Livelihoods and
Economies, Clean Waters, Tourism and
Recreation, the Mariculture sub-goal of Food
Provision, Coastal Protection, Carbon Storage, and
the Lasting Special Places sub-goal of Sense of
Place. In each of these cases there is little evidence
that the overall ecological integrity of the natural
system as measured here directly affects the value
of the goal (or sub-goal) in a broad sense; clearly
specific contrary examples exist. Methods for
calculating ecological integrity are described
below (section 7, Specific Data Layers).
Goal-specific regulations (G) are intended to
describe the factors that set rules and regulations
to address ecological pressures, and are measured
as laws and other institutional measures related to
a specific goal. Governance is a function of 1)
institutional structures that address the intended
objective, 2) a clear process for implementing the
institution is in place, and 3) whether the
institution has been effective at meeting stated
objectives9. At global scales it is very difficult to
assess these three elements; we usually only had
information on whether institutions exist.
However, in some cases we had detailed
information on institutions that enabled us to
assess whether they would contribute to effective
management, and thus, increased ocean health. In
those latter cases, we gave more weight to those
measures. Specifically, we calculated G as a
weighted average:

 
i
i i
w
w G
G , (Eq. 12)
where Gi is the specific regulatory measure
(dataset), and wi is the weight for each i dataset
used to assess G based on the quality of
information contained in the datasets vis-à-vis
estimates of regulation effectiveness (see Table
S3). For habitat resilience and fishing resilience
(all versions), and the CITES signatories
(Convention on the International Trade of
Endangered Species), any country without a score
is given Gi = 0; otherwise, any country without
data for Gi is excluded from Eq. 12 for that
country.

Social integrity is intended to describe those
processes internal to a community that affect its
Resilience. It is a function of a wide range of
aspects of social structure, nearly all of which lack
global data. As such, we rely primarily on WGI
data for each goal as a measure of social integrity,
using the average of the 6 components of WGI in
all cases (see section 2C above for a description of
WGI data and how WGI scores are used for both
Pressures and Resilience). This same approach and
reliance on these WGI data has been used in a
wide variety of other sector-specific ocean related
indices10. For the Coastal Livelihoods and
Economies goal, we also measure sector diversity
(see section 7, Specific Data Layers, for more
details) and the Global Competiveness Index
rescaled from 0 to 1.0 (see Pressures description
above). Social Integrity per goal (YS,x) is therefore:
N
Y
Y
N
i
S i
S x


,
, , (Eq. S13)
where YS,i are the social integrity measures specific
to the goal (in general, only the WGI score).
Ideally, assessments of social resilience would
include state and federal level rules and other
relevant institutional mechanisms as well.
However, such information is extremely difficult
to access for every single country, and so we relied
on global datasets that focus on international
treaties and assessments. Another key gap is
information on social norms and community (and
other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or
use rights) that influence resource use and
management in many settings. Information on
these institutions is also extremely difficult to find
at a global scale, although the WGI partly
measures their effectiveness through its inclusion
of corruption indices.
