*Pressure*

*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer describes the relative pressure of low bycatch commercial fishing practices for each OHI region. These data are calculated using 0.5 degree global raster data for: (1) **Industrial** fish catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP) that describe tons of commercial catch; and, (2) the proportion of catch for each of 5 commercial fishing gear types (Halpern 2008).  Low bycatch commercial fishing is defined as total catch caught by demersal low bycatch (e.g., hook and line) and pelagic low bycatch (e.g., purse seines) gear. For each raster cell, the proportion of catch using low bycatch methods was multiplied by the total tonnes of catch to produce a single layer describing the tonnes of catch using low bycatch methods.  

Catch per cell was then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/)). Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.
