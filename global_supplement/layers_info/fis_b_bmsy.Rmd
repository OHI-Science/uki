Status of global fish stocks based on B/Bmsy values (the ratio of population biomass compared to the biomass required to deliver maximum sustainable yield).  We preferentially used B/Bmsy estimates from formal stock assessments from the  
RAM Legacy Database [http://ramlegacy.org/](http://ramlegacy.org/).  When these data are unavailable, we use the data-limited catch-MSY model (Martell & Frowese 2012) to estimate B/Bmsy values using yearly fish catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP, Zeller and Pauly 2007). SAUP provides catch data (tons per cell) for individual taxa (identified from the species level to "Miscellaneous not identified") at 0.5 degree resolution. For the catch-MSY model, we defined a stock as a species caught within an FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en), which eliminates all the taxa not identified to species level.  This approach assumes that stocks are defined by FAO region, which we know is often not true because multiple stocks of the same species can exist within an FAO region and some stocks cover multiple FAO regions.  However, this assumption is necessary without range maps of stocks. The catch data were summed for each species/FAO region/year, and the catch-MSY model was applied to each stock to estimate B/Bmsy.
