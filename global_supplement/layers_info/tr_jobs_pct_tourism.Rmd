World Travel & Tourism Council ([www.wttc.org/research/economic-data-search-tool/](www.wttc.org/research/economic-data-search-tool/)) provides country data describing the percent employment in the travel and tourism sectors (such as hotels, airlines, airports, travel agents and leisure & recreation services that deal directly with tourists).  We used the percent employment in "direct" tourism jobs as an indicator of the number of tourists visiting the coast.

Regions without data were gapfilled using the average values of UN geopolitical regions.
