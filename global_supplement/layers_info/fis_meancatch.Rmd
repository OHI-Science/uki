Fisheries catch data were averaged across years (e.g., catch values are the same across years within a taxa/region) for each OHI region and taxon. These values were used to weight the stock status scores (derived from B/Bmsy values) in the fisheries model.  Yearly catch data (tonnes) from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP, Zeller and Pauly 2007) is reported at 0.5 degree resolution for taxonomic levels range from species to class to "Miscellaneous not identified". Tonnes of catch for each taxon and year were summed within each OHI region, and then the average catch across years was determined for each taxon and region.
