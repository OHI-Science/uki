*Offshore wave energy*

Waves are a concentrated form of wind energy, their height being determined by wind speed, time exposure to the wind, open water fetch, bathymetry and topography of sea bed. The energy can be approximated to 1/2 * H^2 * T where H is the significant wave height and T is the wave period.
