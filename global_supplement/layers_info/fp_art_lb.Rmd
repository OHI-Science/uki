*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer estimates the relative pressure of artisanal fishing using catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP) at a resolution of 0.5 degrees globally. Artisanal catch (tons) includes 3 of the 4 SAUP reporting sectors: artisanal, subsistence and recreational catch. The catch from these sectors was aggregated for each raster cell, and then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM, [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/)). 

Catch per cell was then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/)). Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.
