Coastal population was determined for each region using Gridded Population of the World (GPW) Population Count Grid Future Estimates (v3) from the Center for International Earth Science Information Net (CIESIN)/Columbia University (CIESIN & CIAT 2005).  Global data were provided at 2.5 arc-minute resolution for 2005, 2010, and 2015. Intervening years were temporally interpolated, as: d2013 = 0.4 * d2010 + 0.6 * d2015. The total coastal population count data was calculated for each region by extracting the relevant cell data using a 25-mile inland coastal zone shapefile. Where modeled coastal population exceeded World Bank reported total population, World Bank figures were used. We used other sources (e.g., World Bank, Wikipedia, etc.) to estimate population for some island regions (Macquarie Island, Wake Island, Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova Island, Bassas da India, Ile Europa, Ile Tromelin, British Indian Ocean Territory, Kerguelen Islands, Heard and McDonald Islands, Bouvet Island, Clipperton Island, Jan Mayen, Palmyra Atoll, Johnston Atoll, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Amsterdam Island and Saint Paul Island).
