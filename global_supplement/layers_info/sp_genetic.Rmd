*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: nonindigenous species*

This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI, Trujillo 2008). In the MSI analysis native species receive the highest score (10), while foreign and introduced species receive the lowest (1) on the premise of potential impacts to local biodiversity if these species were to escape. Use of native but non-local species were scored intermediately based on the assumption that potentially negative alterations to genetic biodiversity occur from non-local sources as well, but to a lower degree. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 53 countries represented). Where multiple scores exist for a country the weighted average of all scores (0-10) is used. All country scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1, using the maximum raw score of 10 and minimum of 1. Countries that were not analyzed by Trujillo did not receive a score and this pressure layer falls out of their analyses.
