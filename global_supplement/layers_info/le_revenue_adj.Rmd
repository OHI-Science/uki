National GDP data were obtained from the World Bank ([http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)).  These data were used in economy subgoal to adjust revenue data. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.
