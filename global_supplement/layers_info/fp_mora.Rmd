*Resilience*

*Category: ecological/regulatory*

*Subcategory: fishing*

These data describe the current effectiveness of fisheries management regimes along 6 axes (Mora et al. 2009): scientific robustness, policy transparency, implementation capacity, subsidies, fishing effort, and foreign fishing. All countries with coastal areas were assessed through a combination of surveys, empirical data and enquiries to fisheries experts. For each OHI reporting region, scores for each category were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the maximum possible value for each category and then the average score of all 6 categories was used as the overall fisheries management effectiveness score.
