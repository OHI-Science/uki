*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This layer describes the relative pressure of high bycatch commercial fishing practices for each OHI region. These data are calculated using 0.5 degree global raster data for: (1) **Industrial** fish catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP) that describe tons of commercial catch; and, (2) the proportion of catch for each of 5 commercial fishing gear types (Halpern 2008).  High bycatch commercial fishing is defined as total catch caught by demersal destructive (e.g., trawl), demersal non-destructive high bycatch (e.g., pots, traps) and pelagic high bycatch (e.g., long-line) gear. For each raster cell, the proportion of catch using high bycatch gear was multiplied by the total tonnes of catch to produce a single layer describing the tonnes of catch using high bycatch methods.  

Catch per cell is then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Catch per cell was then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2^/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM,  [http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/](http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/)). Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region. The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.
