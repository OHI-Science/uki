UN geopolitical region classifications (United Nations Statistics Division, 2016; [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)). These data are often used for gapfilling missing data.  Level r0 is the most general classification, and all OHI regions have the same classification (World), r1 includes seven geopolitical classes (Africa, Americas, etc.), and r2 includes 22 geopolitical classes (Caribbean, Central America, etc.).
