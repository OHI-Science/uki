Travel advisories are from the U.S. State Department ([https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html)).  Penalty scores were based on the urgency of warning (‘risk’=0.25, ‘avoid unnecessary travel’=0.75, and ‘avoid all travel’ = 1). Penalties for region-specific warnings (within a country) were assessed at half the weight.
