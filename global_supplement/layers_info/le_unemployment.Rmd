Unemployment data were from the World Bank ([http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS)). These data are reported as the percent of the total labor force that is available to work and seeking employment but is without work. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.
