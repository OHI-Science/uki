This layer represents the opportunity for artisanal and recreational fishing in each country based on the quality of management of the small-scale fishing sector. Global data were extracted from Mora et al. (2009), Figure S4. Figure S4 is based on two expert opinion survey questions related to artisanal and recreational fishing (classified as small-scale fishing; presented in Table S5). Overall scores for small-scale fisheries management for each country are based on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better management. These values were then rescaled (using a maximum value of 100 and minimum value of 0) to range between 0 and 1 for each OHI region.

Questions from Mora et al. that were used to evaluate access to artisanal scale fishing:

If recreational fishing exists to any extent, which of the following apply?

* Are recreational fishermen required to have a fishing license? Y/N
* Are there regulations to the size of fish caught? Y/N
* Are there regulations to the number of fish caught? Y/N
* Are there regulations to the number of fishermen allowed to fish? Y/N
* Are there statistics being collected for this sort of fishing? Y/N
