*Offshore tidal energy* 

Tidal energy is generated due to changes in the gravitational forces that induce cyclic variations of the sea level, resulting in water currents. 
The potential power is a influenced by the fluid density (rho), swept area (A) and the local fluid velocity (U) according to the formula:
P=1/2 * rho * A * U^3
